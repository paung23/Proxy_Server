## Proxy Server Project (CPS 373)

### Introduction
This is the final project by Austin Butz and Phyo Thuta Aung for CPS 373.

Some quick Git tips:

Normally, we would make new branches, work on them and merge them back, but for this project, I think it's fine for us
to just work on one branch (the main branch). Please make sure to pull before pushing your code! You can follow the
code below everytime you want to put stuffs in our repo (I believe those are all correct! lol).

```
git pull origin master
git add -A
git commit -m "I have made some changes."
git push origin master
```

### Codebase
The main file is at [src/ProxyServer.cpp](https://github.com/paung23/Proxy_Server/blob/master/src/ProxyServer.cpp).
